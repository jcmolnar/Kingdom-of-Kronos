PrestoPlus is an upgrade to PrestoPack v 0.93 and was created to take advantage 
of a new message parsing script by MT.  This means that everything in the original 
PrestoPack 0.93 is exactly the same....except faster.

Users of fast machines may not notice any difference at all, but lower end
machines have been getting up to 20% increases in fps.

Client side support was also added for BWADMIN version 5 servers and later. 
This support will update your DynHud Objective Info on connection to the server
as well as completely replace all killtrak message parsing when connected to
a bwadmin v5.0+ server.


INSTALLATION:

	1) Make a copy of your existing Tribes\Config\Presto directory elsewhere
		on your hard disk (just in case).
	2) Extract PrestoPlus.zip with full pathnames into your tribes
		directory overwriting all existing files.
			ie. c:\Dynamix\Tribes\    or your equivalent.
	3) Run tribes :)
	
	If your previous copy of prestopack was installed correctly then 
	everything should be working fine.

	
UNINSTALLATION:

	Use this procedure to return to a orginal PrestoPack install.
	
	1) Copy all the files from Tribes\Config\Presto\PrestoBackup directory
		into your Tribes\Config\Presto directory overwriting all files.
		
	Thats it........uninstalled.
	
	NOTE: The files in the Tribes\Config\Presto\PrestoBackup are unmodified
		originals as supplied by the Presto pack. If you have modified any of
		the original files, uninstalling as described will lose any of the
		changes you have made.
