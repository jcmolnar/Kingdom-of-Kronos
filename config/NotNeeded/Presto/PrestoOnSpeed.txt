   PJ's Presto Pack (KillTrak and TeamTrak) on Speed- Updated 9/2/2000

   *** NOTICE***

   This is an updated version that includes full support for adding of new
   Death Messages by Mods and other Script files. With this addition
   PJ's Kill Trak script the fastest most compatible replacement for Presto
   Pack. Download and enjoy the savings in speed!

   ***NOTICE***

   This is a replacement for the KillTrak.cs script included in Presto Pack.
   Presto's Kill Tracking routine can cause incredable slowdowns when you are
   in a heavy game due to it checking every text line that passes using his
   Generic Matching routines.   I have written this using specialised matching
   that do not use any of the Presto Match commands. In addition to the faster
   matching routines you can set the Kill Trak to ONLY track kills and deaths 
   associated with you.   Presto's routine will parse and track any kill or death
   made by EVERYONE in the game. There are very, very few scripts that will
   use this feature.   It can easily be toggled on or off by setting...

   $KillTrak::PlayerOnly = "true" // Only parses Death Messages with your name in them

   $KillTrak::PlayerOnly = "false" // Parses Death Messages for every player in the game

   The default setting is "true" and in mose cases it should be left at that
   setting. If you experience problems or have a script that needs the kill
   tracking information for everyone just set it to "false".  You can find
   this variable in the killtrak.cs script.

   In either case this Kill Traking Replacement for Presto is faster than the
   old one no matter what setting you use.

   I have updated PJ's Kill Trak to be compatible with scripts that are
   looking for the old Kill Tracking message list format. This will not
   affect the speed of this script in any way as this is not used by the kill
   tracking and just added to enhanced compatability.

   This is the promised faster Team Trak script for Presto Pack. I have
   removed some redundant code that never gets used for anything (looks like
   a left over from early testing) but was processed anyway. Plus I have
   added the faster method of parsing Team Trak messages related to the flag
   status. You may not notice any speed increase on fast systems but it is
   there and slower systems will notice that flag events nolonger cause a
   slight pause.

   When you couple this with my Drop in Replacement for Kill Trak you will have
   one of the fastest Presto Pack configurations availible.

   Just unzip this download directly into your Presto Directory. The original
   KillTrak.cs and TeamTrak.cs are saved into an OldPresto directory if you
   want a backup.
