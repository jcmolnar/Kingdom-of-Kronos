// Okay, welcome to my pack.  This is the file where you'll make
// your Presto Preference (tm)(c)(R) changes.
//
// Read the next section very carefully!  This will determine the
// features which are installed.
//
// Where it asks for a key, enter a key name like "v" or "q" or
// "p".  You can also use "control d" or "alt b", in fact, the
// words here are just the same as the words used in the bind()
// command, except that there's no comma between multiple words.
// if you want to disable a feature, set the key to "false".
//
// Some features are just toggles, which you can set to "true"
// if you want the feature or "false" if you don't.

// Features enabled and bound to keys
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
//
//	New Chat Menu
//
// 	Do you want the new chat menus?  By default I hide these for
// 	distribution.  I think the new chat menus are cool though
// 	and I recommend turning them on.  You can replace your old
// 	menu or put them on a different key.  I tried to make them as
// 	close to the original menus as possible, so you'd want to put
//	them on your V key.  Set this to a key, or "false" to turn
//	off this feature completely.
$PrestoPref::NewChat = "false";
//
//	Old Chat Menu
//
//	This, unfortunately IS NOT AN OPTION.  You must in this file
//	tell me where you have your old voice menu key bound.  Usually
//	this is the V key.  It's whatever you hit to make voice sayings
//	like "need repairs!".  What?  You don't use that menu? Shame
//	on you, you should be a better team player.
//	If you set this to false YOU WILL NOT HAVE YOUR OLD CHAT MENU
//	ANY MORE.  (Which isn't that bad if you have the new chat menu.)
$PrestoPref::OldChat = "v";
//
//	Inventory Camera
//
// 	Do you want a camera on your inventory station window?  When you
// 	access the station, this feature will also turn you around.
// 	That way you can see who is waiting in line behind you!  This
// 	is a very cool feature and I turn it on for distribution.
// 	Set this to "true" to turn it on or "false" to turn it off.
$PrestoPref::InvCamera = false;
//
//	Drop Menu
//
//	This is a new menu which will let you drop weapons and ammo
//	by picking them in a menu rather than just dropping whatever
//	you're holding.  I designed it so lights could carry mortar
//	ammo for heavies!  By default I have this menu turned on -
//	but the key I have chosen (control D) is bound to the command
//	"Unable to complete objective" in the default Tribes install.
//	I recommend that before running this script, you go rebind
//	that key.  It's not particularly a "control D" kind of command,
//	and drop is :)
$PrestoPref::DropMenu = false;
//
//	Job Menu
//
//	I've introduced a new chat menu, which I call the job menu.
//	This is a version of the V-chat menu which lets you get very
//	specific with what you're doing and what needs to be done!
//	For instance "we need to repair the generator!" instead of
//	just "need repairs."
//	This menu is by default bound to the control-G key.  I would
//	rather you bind it to the G key.  The reason I used control is
//	because G is by default bound to Grenades.  Please reassign
//	that function.  This menu is designed to go on the G key and
//	you will find it MUCH more useful on that key.
//	Set it to a key, or to false to disable the feature.
$PrestoPref::JobMenu = false;
//
//	Team HUD
//
//	Designed to let you see what's going on with your team, the
//	Team HUD sits at the bottom of your screen and tells you who
//	is on offense, who is on defense, and other useful information.
//	It's especially useful in combination with the Job menu,
//	because the specific information will be displayed in the HUD.
//	By default, I map this key to control-T.  You can assign it
//	to a key or "false" to turn off the feature.
$PrestoPref::TeamHud = "control t";
//
//	Dynamic HUD
//
//	This is the feature that got it all started!  KillerBunny's
//	dyn_hud was a great script, and he gave me permission to
//	upgrade it and include it in this script pack.  The DynHud
//	tracks the status of flags in a capture-the-flag game.  It
//	also keeps track of your mines, grenades, and hey, for you
//	statistical types it'll tell you how many painful deaths
//	you've inflicted ... and how many you've received! :)
//	Bind this to a key, which toggles it on and off - or "false".
$PrestoPref::DynHud = "false";
//
//	Mute Menu
//
//	The Mute Menu lets you control your client-side muting.
//	From this menu you can mute a variety of messages, including
//	noisy (verbal) messages and repeat messages, for

// 	I like it at 120, but it's got a fisheye effect some people

// 	screen, only the camHUD.  I set it to 90 for the distribution.
$PrestoPref::CamHudFOV = 90;

//	So you're at a station and you want to look around for a second
//	through the little camera window.  Well, hold this key down
//	and you'll be in free look mode - release it and you'll be back

//	You can also make free-look the default, in which case the
//	free look button will temporarily turn your pointer back ON
//	instead of turning it off.

// Turn Around prefs (Inventory Camera)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
//
// 	These are used to turn you around in CamHUD - if you're happy

//	This specifies the location of the TeamHUD.  Note the use of
//	extended coordinates to size it to the full width, and put
//	it at the bottom of the screen.   If you put it near the bottom
//	of the screen it will size upwards, near the top it will size
//	downwards.  The height you specify here will determine the
//	height of a *single row* - as the HUD resizes it will size in

//	My personal preferences are to move the teamHUD to the lower
//	right corner @ "100% 100% 60% 14", with 3 columns, leaving
//	space on the left side for a HUD.  I also tried the setting
//	"100% 100% 20% 14" with one column, which lets it grow against
//	the right side.  Feel free to experiment!

// Muting preferences
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
//
//	While client-side muting can save you from a spammer, it
//	also eats a little processor time for every message whether
//	you end up muting it or not!
//	If you want to turn off muting, set this to false.
$PrestoPref::Mute = false;
//
//	Next, you can set your default muting preferences.
//
//	Note that the following preferences will take effect even if
//	you don't have the MuteMenu installed.  However you can use
//	the mute menu to turn them on & off, and also add particular
//	clients to the mute list (which you can't do with these
//	defaults)
//
// 	In each of the following defaults, you can use the following
// 	words in a space-separated string:
//		* all - every message is muted
//		* noise - any message with noise is muted
//		* repeat - any repeated messages are muted
//		* packs - "Pack" messages are muted.  You'll need to
//			install the mute packs to have this work.
//	For example "noise packs".  In this example *both* noises and
//	packs will be muted.
//
//	See MUTE.CS for more information about "packs" muting and
//	how you can build your own muting packs.
//
//	Messages by anyone in the game:
$PrestoPref::Mute[all] = "";
//	Messages by friendly team members:
$PrestoPref::Mute[friendly] = "";
//	Messages by enemy team members:
$PrestoPref::Mute[enemy] = "";
//
//	Obviously if you have something in friendly AND enemy, it might
//	as well be in "all" instead.
//
// 	The following lines are commented out, meaning it will not
// 	actually run.  But they are my default mute settings, which
//	you can use if you want - by taking out the // in front.
// $PrestoPref::Mute[all] = "repeat packs"; // unnecessary stuff
// $PrestoPref::Mute[friendly] = "";
// $PrestoPref::Mute[enemy] = "noise";	// i don't hear taunts
//	This last one is a bit dangerous because you might miss
//	voice messages like "yes" and "no" or "hi" and "bye".
//
//	When a message is muted, a small HUD will appear to tell you
//	you just missed a message.  This is so that you can't
//	accidentally mute all, and then wonder why you aren't
//	getting any messages.  The default position for the mute
//	HUD is at the top center of the screen, right above the
//	chat window.  If you've moved your chat window you might
//	want to move the mute HUD too.

//
//	If you're worried you might miss a message due to muting,
//	this setting will display the first few characters of each
//	muted message, in the muting HUD.  This will be enough to
//	read "yes" or "no", for instance.  Note that muted messages
//	are always displayed in the console so if you see a muted
//	message you think you might have wanted to see, just pop
//	open the console and read it there in its entirety.

// Kill-Tracking preferences
// ---------------------------------------------------------------
//
// 	Kill-tracking is cool and lots of HUDs & scripts use it.  But
//	for some it might be unnecessary overhead, since it compares
//	every message you get against a (potentially long) list of
//	death messages.  If you want to save a little processor power
//	at the expense of not getting any death tracking, set this to
//	false.
$PrestoPref::KillTrak = false;

// Strict Name Checking preference
// ---------------------------------------------------------------

// 	Enable this only if you think people are purposely screwing
// 	around with your scripts by using funny names.  It could slow

$PrestoPref::StrictNameChecking = false;

// Pack Status Window preferences

// 	If you have a favorite banner you can specify it here.  Maybe
//	it's your own and you're testing the banner ad, or maybe you
//	just like someone's banner.

//	script banners.  But if you know the name of a script (the
